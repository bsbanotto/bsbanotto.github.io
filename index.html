      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <img src="path_to_your_photo.jpg" alt="Your Photo">
      <p>
        At my core, I'm a person who is excited by innovative solutions to problems devised by a great team.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am originally from Northwest Arkansas. I relocated to Tulsa in 2011 and am currently studying Machine Learning at Holberton Tulsa. Prior to this, I spent 10 years as a mechanical engineer specializing in process improvement. Outside of work, I am a triathlete and enjoy racing in the occasional local race. After I graduate from Holberton, I am looking for a role where I can combine my past problem solving and technical leadership skills with my growing set of technical skills to solve challenges facing the community around me.
      </p>
      <p>
        Throughout my education and career, I have always been a person who likes to vocalize off-the-wall, unnatural solutions to the challenges we face. While these ideas are never implemented in full, I've found they are a great way to open the door for others to speak their thoughts and creates a unique atmosphere for brainstorming.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some facts about me for trivia night:
        <ul>
         <li>I'm a very amateur triathlete. I completed my first IronMan in Tulsa in 2021</li>
         <li>I'm a pretty good cook, and love trying out new recipes</li>
         <li>I love a Gantt chart. It has consistently proven itself as my go-to tool to stay organized on large projects</li>
      </ul>
